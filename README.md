# test---IT-Process-Management
Greeting Dr Khurana, 
Thanks for giving us the assignment, it helped me to get used to github, as I don't use it that much, howvever this semester I am working
on Home Drone project for my capstone class, this project is a small scale clone of Home security app, operated using Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Android app. For the project, we use github and have respository since all of the group members are working on different parts and at the end we need to integrate everything together, in order for the system to work with all components. Since this semester is comming to end, I would like to tell you that it was a real pleasure sitting and learning from your class. As a Computer science major, I would never have got the oppurtunity to learn the bussiness processes in IT. As matter of fact, after my bachelors, I am planning to get an MBA switch from technical field to management field. All in all IT Process Management was worth all time and got to learn a lot.
